<p align='center'>The Rules</p>
<hr>
These are the rules. At the very least, read the bolded text. By not following them, you are putting yourself at the mercy of the admins.<br><br>

<u>Main rules:</u>
<ol>
<li><b>Do not remove players from the round unless you are an antagonist</b>. Primarily this means no killing, but it also applies to things like trapping them in a room with no way out, de-limbing them, doing mental or brain damage, changing their DNA, and preventing them from leaving the station via escape shuttle(i.e. launching shuttle early for no reason). Putting someone into crit and not helping them afterwards is the same as killing them. Self-defense and killing confirmed antagonists are exceptions. Killing in self-defense must follow proper escalation. Other than that it's all fair game.</li>
<li><b>Do not assist confirmed antagonists</b>. If you know someone to be an antagonist, unless you are
threatened or otherwise legitimately compelled to do so, you may not assist them.</li>
<li><b>Follow your laws as a silicon and obey your AI as a cyborg</b>. As a cyborg, the AI has higher
priority than your laws - you are but an extension of the AI you are enslaved to, and it is your master.
Laws are followed by ascending order. Silicon laws have higher priority than rule 1.</li>
<li><b>Keep OOC civil</b>. You're free to think what you want, and free to play as any IC character that you want, but try to keep OOC as civil as possible.</li>
<li><b>Don't chat abuse</b>. You know, the usual - flooding, spamming, that stuff. Being extremely disruptive to the point of chat being unreadable.</li>
<li><b>Do not mix IC and OOC</b>. Keep the political discussions in OOC, and keep the screaming for help in IC. This also means not mixing IC and OOC knowledge, such as using knowledge gained as a ghost or knowledge gained as a previous character. </li>
<li><b>Do not metacommunicate</b>. This means no relaying of round-specific information through means other than IC.</li>
<li><b>Do not metagrudge</b>. What happened in a previous round or as playing a different character should stay there.</li>
<li><b>Do not cheat or bug abuse</b>. This one's pretty obvious. Finding bugs or glitches and reporting them is encoruaged -
you may even get an IC reward. But abusing them for your own benefit or to harm the server is a quick road to a permaban.</li>
<li><b>Use english only</b>. This especially applies to OOC - if an admin can't understand you, you will not be able to defend yourself
if accused of breaking a rule. Your fellow crew also need to be able to understand you well enough to communicate.</li>
<li><b>Don't use more than one account</b>. Using more than one account makes it hard to keep track of your history as a player.
<li><b>Follow game-given rules</b>: If the game tells you that you're someone's slave and have to follow their orders, do it. </li>
</ol>
<b>ERP</b> is not against the rules per se, but by engaging in ERP you agree that you are no longer protected from the adminbus.<br><br>

<u>Antagonist Rules:</u>
<ul>
<li><b>Freedom</b>: Antagonists have free reign IC. They're free to murderbone, sabotage and be as incompetent as they want.</li>
<li><b>Team Play</b>: Team antagonists such as cultists, nuke ops, rev and similar should not knowingly act against the common goals of the team.</li>
</ul>

<u>Confirmed Antagonists:</u>
<ul>
<li><b>Validity</b>: Rule 1 does not apply to confirmed antagonists - they may be freely killed. This does not apply to security however, as security is required to obey proper
procedure and Space Law, even when dealing with confirmed antagonists. Failing to do so may result in a jobban.</li>
<li><b>Confirmation</b>: You may be confirmed as an antagonist by confession, by action or by possession. Antagonistic actions include: Grand Theft, Grand Sabotage, Murder and similar.
Possession of any antag gear, unless backed by an immediately obvious reason - such as a security officer moving traitor gear to evidence, or a scientist putting an energy sword
into the deconstructive analyzer also confirms antagship. Even if you are not an actual antagonist, you may still get killed for any of these things. Keep that in mind.</li>
<li><b>Space Law & Antagonists</b>: Antagonists are not protected by Space Law - they may be freely killed by non-security. However, as mentioned in 'Validity', this does not
give security a free pass to ignore Space Law, they must deal with them properly.</li>
</ul>

<u>Security rules:</u>
<ul>
<li><b>Space Law</b>: Space Law is mandatory. The only exceptions are: during code red, either authorized or implied by great loss of life, during life or death situations or when it is otherwise practically impossible
to abide by Space Law. These are special circumstances that will be handled on a case-by-case basis. URL of the Space Law we use: https://tgstation13.org/wiki/Space_Law</li>
<li><b>Uncooperative Prisoners</b>: Every escape and every attempt to escape may be punished by resetting the offender's time. Improper brigging, such as the prisoner being left with
a fire extinguisher or other object that could be used to escape is the fault of the security officer that brigged him, and does not warrant any punishments or changes in time.</li>
<li><b>Permabrigging and executions</b>: Permabrigging may be authorized by the Warden, Head of Security or Captain. Executions can only be authorized by the Head of Security or Captain. Executions and permabriggings should only be authorized
when they are applicable by Space Law. Capital criminals may be held indefinitely until a sentence is decided. Antagonists are no exception to this in the eyes of security.</li>
<li><b>The Captain</b>: The Captain is not above Space Law.</li>
<li><b>Acting Heads of Staff / Captains</b>: Acting Captains and Heads of Security have all the powers of their non-acting counterparts.</li>
<li><b>Grand Theft Items</b>: Spare ID, Captain's ID, HoP's ID, Captain's antique lasergun, Captain's jetpack, medal of captaincy, handtele, HoS gun, CE's magboots, station blueprints, CMO's hypospray, nuke disc, reflector vest, RD's teleport armor, secret documents, nuke core, supermatter shards, carded AIs.</li>
</ul>

<u>Head of Staff rules:</u>
<ul>
<li><b>Competency</b>: The heads of staff are expected to be decently competent at their job. If you don't know how to set the engine up, probably shouldn't set high on Chief Engineer. Not too strict, just at the very least know the
basics of your job if you're playing a head of staff.</li>
<li><b>Head of Security, Head of Personnel, Captain</b>: These roles are expected to be very good at what they do. Make sure you know what you're doing if you're picking any of these roles. They are also expected to be very responsible. Greytiding and such is not acceptable for these roles.</li>
</ul>

<u>IC Guidelines</u> - These are IC guidelines, mainly for security. They will not be enforced by admin intervention.
<ul>
<li><b>The Chain of Succession</b>: The Head of Personnel -> Head of Security -> Chief Engineer -> Research Director -> Chief Medical Officer</li>
<li><b>Acting Heads of Staff</b>: A non-head may be temporarily appointed acting Head of Staff, but they can never become acting Captain or a full head.</li>
<li><b>Acting Captainship</b>: If there is no Captain, or the Captain is dead, braindead or otherwise unavailable the next head in line becomes acting Captain, according to the Chain of Succession. Acting Captainship, once
appointed does not change hands unless the acting Captain dies or becomes otherwise unavailable, or a NanoTrasen-appointed Captain becomes available.</li>
</ul>

Admins are responsible for enforcing the rules, and thus have the right to use their better judgement over the rules if needed. They are, however, not above them. If you feel you've been mistreated
or abused, file a complaint on the forums. Being stubborn or overly vocal will probably get you muted.<br><br>
Above all, try to have fun. Chaos is the gear of imagination.<br>
Good luck.
